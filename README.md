# Let See

Over the course of January - June I will dedicate this period to be learning the C programming language. This repo will contain examples and exercises from various resources.

## Motivations

Why learn C? is a very popular question and i seriously don't have the answer(yet!) but here are my motivations for learning the C language.

* Build core foundation: By learning the C language, I will be building core foundations in both Computer Science & Programming since C is basis of most modern day programming language.
* Respect for modern day programming language: A lot of high level programming language do a lot for us but we take it for granted, C being a minimal language will teach you(me) respect.
* Fun: So far it's been fun.
* Data Structures/Algorithm: Knowledge of C will help in understanding of the fundamental data structures and how common algorithm works.
* C++: C will help me with l

## Resorces

The following are the books I will be using for learning C:

* C HOW TO PROGRAM by P.J & H.M DEITEL
* The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie

## Projects

These are the final projects:

* Make pong game with allegro Library.
* Make a text editor with C.
